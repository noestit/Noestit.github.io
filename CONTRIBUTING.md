### Help us triaging issues better, by following next steps:
1. If issue is a feature request, discuss amongst Noest devs.
    * If we decide to adapt it, add to the Features milestone
    * If we decide not to adapt it, just close.
2. If issue is a improvement suggestion or change, attempt to verify
    * If it's a duplicate, close with link to other issue already reported
    * If it ultimaltely can't be verified, close until we have enough information to verify (e.g., in most cases we will discuss all made issues on a Guardian meetup)
    * If the user hasn't provided enough information, keep asking for enough information.
    * If we have been waiting for a reply from the user for over 3 weeks, close.
