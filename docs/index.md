> Codeguidelines and best-practices to help build readable, quality-code projects across frameworks, languages, platforms, etc. Made by the Noest team.

Codeguidelines agreed on by the Noest team to have alignment across projects and within a company.
These range from multiple code languages such as Javascript and C# to frameworks and other subjects such as git, gitflow, etc...

These are mere guidelines proposed by us to follow, this to ensure code quality and readability. But overal to create solid structured small or vast repositories.
Suggestions are always welcome and these guidelines can/will change over time.

## :dart: Motivation
Developers tend to have there own ways of working with code, however when working in teams it's often recommended to follow some basic guidelines or best practices to maximize co-creation. Noest is a consultancy company, in order to make the conveyance as smooth as possible guidelines have to be followed. Because of these guidelines developers across languages/frameworks will share more basic principles making transitions faster and causing delays less prone to happen.
